STRUCTURE
=========
- CMake build and run profile for Visual Studio.
- Where to place desturctor? At top or bottom of public functions?
- Actor? Mesh? Entity? GameObject? 
	What is something that has a position in the world?
	What is something that has a 3D mesh and texture and shader?
	But then what is a trigger volume?

- Flow? Engine update > Renderer but has to get all game objects to draw and shaders and...

CONVENTION
----------
What parts of C++ std to allow? unique_ptr?

RENDERER
========
- Add cube.
- Add mesh class that handles VBO, VAO, EBO, shaders, OpenGL stuff .
- Add shader class to parse and feed shaders to the mesh.
- Add floating camera.
- Improve shader code with error handling.

INPUT-MANAGER
=============
- Events? Bitset? Must be easily managed by the game module.

UTILS
=====
- Add simple benchmark tool.
- Improve Files.cpp:
	- Remove memory leak on string allocation.
	- Translate \\ and / so same path works on both MS-DOS and Unix.
