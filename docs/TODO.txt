STRUCTURE
=========
- CMake build and run profile for Visual Studio.
- Get ClangFormat file?
- Use std::uint_32t and such? Which header to use? fast uint32?
	Put them in a header so I don't have to uint_fast32_t it gets very verbose. FG24::u32f?
	Does std::uint_fast32_t even do anything fast? Will it ever be 64?
- Remove need to "../"
- Where to place desturctor? At top or bottom of public functions?

CONVENTION
----------
What parts of C++ std to allow? unique_ptr?


RENDERER
========
- Add mesh class that handles VBO, VAO, EBO, shaders, OpenGL stuff .
- Add shader class to parse and feed shaders to the mesh.
- Add cube.
- Add floating camera.

INPUT-MANAGER
=============
- Events or bitset? Must be easily managed by the game module.
